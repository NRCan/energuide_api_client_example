# ✨ NRCAN Example ✨

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/cds-snc/nrcan-example/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/cds-snc/nrcan-example/tree/master) . \* ･ ｡ﾟ☆━੧༼ •́ ヮ •̀ ༽୨

This is a small recipe/example for using React & Apollo Client to display data from the NRCAN API, as seen here: https://github.com/cds-snc/nrcan_api. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which you can find out more about in the UI folder readme.

This project is currently on hold and will not be kept up to date with changes to the API, so actual data fetching will likely not work.

## Running the example

You can install & run the example with the following commands:

```
cd ui
yarn install
yarn start
```

The example application will open at http://localhost:3000

## Test the things

To run the test suite:

```
cd ui
yarn test
```
